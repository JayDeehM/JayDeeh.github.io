# My portfolio

This is another version of my portfolio. This was created with rails.

##### Why rails?

I decided to make it in rails so that everytime that I would want to add a new project that I made or if I learned a new skill, it would be easier for me to upload them. 

And ofcourse I will still continue to update my portfolio in code.
